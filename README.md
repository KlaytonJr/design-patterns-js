## Overview
Welcome to my Advanced To-Do List project! ðŸ“‹ 

In this project, I took a unique approach by implementing all design patterns of JavaScript to create a more complex and intricate to-do list application.

### Why a To-Do List?
You might be wondering, why a seasoned developer like me would choose a seemingly simple project. Well, my goal was to challenge myself and delve deep into the world of JavaScript design patterns. This project allowed me to explore and implement various patterns in a real-world scenario.

## Features
- [X] Add your to-dos using advanced patterns
- [X] Mark tasks as completed
- [X] Explore different design patterns within the codebase

## Project Structure
While the organization may not be perfect due to the challenge of implementing all design patterns in one project, it provides valuable insights into when and where each pattern is best applied.

## Getting Started
To run the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Start managing your to-dos with advanced JavaScript patterns!

## Learning Takeaways
Although not recommended for real-world scenarios, this project served as an excellent learning experience. Here are some key takeaways:
- Insight into different JavaScript design patterns
- Understanding when to use specific patterns and when not to

## Future Improvements
While I may not attempt such a complex project again, I welcome suggestions and improvements for this one. Feel free to contribute and help enhance this learning resource.
